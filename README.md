## Introduction

This project works on how to realize augmented reality demonstration program, how to use JavaScript API. 

Since WebGL is a simple platform in developing, however along with THREE.js, WebGL not only become an un-alternative platform but give developer much than ever conveniences. 

Thanks to the effort from many open-source program in Github, makes it really convenient than self-learning to study up-to-date augmented reality and get started to work on it. 

Below, introduction to the background to the research on augmented reality as well as the developing future of it.
